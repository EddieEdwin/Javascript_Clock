# Time in words

Recently I came across a clock from QlockTwo which displays the time in words (in this case in Dutch).
In this coding challange I decided to recreate this clock digitally in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Minutes are displayed using lit dots in the corners, each dot representing 1 minute on top of the current time in words.
